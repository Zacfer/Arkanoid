Parts of the coursework attempted:

I have attempted all parts of the coursework.
Parts 1-5 were attempted as specified per the instructions.

For the extension I decided to make a basic version of an "Arkanoid" game, in the style of a "Pong" game, in the sense that I deal with abstractions of pixels and not drawn images and sounds.

The purpose of the game is to destroy all of the bricks, ensuring with the block you control that the ball does not fall to the bottom.

I have explained my implementation in my code's comments.
